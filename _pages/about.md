Hi! I am Prith Sengupta, a CS PhD Candidate at University of Illinois at Chicago. My research interests lie broadly in the area of Theoretical Computer Science specifically Graph Theory. I work on analyzing various real world networks using different notions of curvatures which were originally defined for smooth continuous Riemannian manifolds.
