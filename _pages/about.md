Hi! I am Prithviraj Sengupta, a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). I work under the guidance of [Prof. Bhaskar DasGupta](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~dasgupta/), as a part of the [Theory Group](http://theory.cs.uic.edu/). My research interests span several areas such as Theoretical Computer Science, Graph Theory, Computational Biology and Computer Vision. Currently, I am investigating various notions of curvatures and working on discretizing them in order to analyze different real world networks such as Traumatic Brain Injury Networks.


Prior to joining UIC, I completed my Bachelors' from [KIIT University](https://kiit.ac.in/) with a major in Computer Science. During my undergrad, I spent time at [NIT Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/) and [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) working on different problems on Image Forensics. I also spent some time in the industry working at [Deloitte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte) as an Advisory Analyst.


Apart from research, I take deep interest in music, philosophy, cricket and traveling. Please feel to reach out if you want to chat about any of these topics.
